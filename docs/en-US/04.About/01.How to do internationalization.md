**How to do internationalization?**



Under `/docs/docs/` path, the default language is Chinese (zh); you can put the translated documents in the folder according to the corresponding folder below, if you want it to be other languages, you can refer to `en-US` folder structure to create a new one.

```bash
.
├── 01.DTK
├── 02. Experience sharing
├── 03.Community Works
├── 04.About
├─ en-US
│ ├── 01.DTK
│ ├── 02.Experience Sharing
│ ├── 03.Community creations
About │ └── 04.
└── README.md
```



**Attention**

Both folder and file names must be preceded by a number, such as `01.xxxx` or `01.xxxx.md`, xxx is the specific name, `. `, otherwise the parsing will fail. The number in front of it can be discontinuous, and the number is only used to generate the left navigation bar in the last order.
